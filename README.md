**Avian Influenza Virus – Spatial Phylogenetic & Epidemiological Analysis of
Circulation, Integration, Assortment & Lineage**

---

## Overview

**AIV-SPECIAL** is a statistical framework for **joint spatial–phylogenetic analysis of avian influenza virus (AIV)**.
It integrates viral sequence evolution, geographic circulation, and genome-segment reassortment into a **single coherent inference pipeline**, enabling robust reconstruction of lineage dynamics across space and time.

Unlike descriptive phylogeography, **SPECIAL emphasizes model-based integration** of epidemiological and evolutionary signals, with explicit handling of uncertainty.

## Conceptual Structure

SPECIAL is organized around four analytical pillars:

### **Circulation**

Quantifies spatial and temporal virus movement using phylogeny-informed geographic diffusion and population structure estimation.

### **Integration**

The core methodological contribution.
SPECIAL integrates:

* spatial epidemiological signals
* phylogenetic tree structure
* genome segment relationships

into a unified statistical inference framework, rather than treating them as independent analyses.

### **Assortment**

Detects and characterizes genome segment reassortment events within a spatial–phylogenetic context, linking reassortment to circulation patterns and co-circulation regimes.

### **Lineage**

Reconstructs lineage emergence, persistence, and replacement dynamics, accounting for reassortment-driven lineage reshaping rather than assuming tree-like evolution alone.

## Key Methodological Features

* Joint spatial–phylogenetic inference
* Probabilistic integration of multi-segment viral genomes
* Explicit treatment of reassortment as a lineage-modifying process
* Scalable to large AIV datasets across regions and hosts
* Designed for hypothesis-driven evolutionary epidemiology, not only visualization

---

## Scope and Use Cases

AIV-SPECIAL is designed for:

* Reconstructing AIV spatial circulation dynamics
* Identifying reassortment-associated lineage shifts
* Quantifying regional introduction and spread patterns
* Comparing circulation regimes across time, geography, or host systems
* Methodological research in viral phylogeography and evolutionary epidemiology

---

## Philosophy

SPECIAL treats **space, phylogeny, and genome structure as inseparable components** of viral evolution.
The framework prioritizes **statistical integration over sequential analysis**, reducing interpretational bias introduced by disconnected pipelines.

## Status

This repository contains the analytical framework and supporting code for AIV-SPECIAL.
Detailed implementation, validation, and case studies are documented in accompanying manuscripts and supplementary materials.
